# Implementation Log - Journal Screen MVP

## Files Created or Modified

### 1. `components/journal/MealCard.tsx`
**Purpose:**  
Displays individual meal entries in the journal timeline with an image and timestamp.

**Functionality:**  
- Renders a card component with an image and formatted time
- Uses TypeScript interface `MealCardProps` for type safety
- Handles image display with proper sizing and border radius
- Formats timestamps into readable time format (HH:mm)

**Notes:**  
- Uses responsive sizing based on device width
- Implements exact 3:2 aspect ratio for images
- Follows mockup design specifications

**Updates (Card Design Improvements):**
- Added centralized color definitions
- Implemented continuous timeline with masked dots
- Refined typography and spacing
- Added proper shadow effects
- Improved image container handling
- Commit: `style: improve MealCard design to match mockup`

### 2. `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
**Purpose:**  
Configures the bottom tab navigation structure for the entire app.

**Functionality:**  
- Sets up three main tabs: Journal, Add, and Dashboard
- Configures tab icons using Ionicons
- Implements a special center "+" button for meal addition
- Includes header configuration with notification and settings icons

**Notes:**  
- Uses Expo Router for navigation
- Add button currently only logs to console
- Can be extended to handle camera/image picker integration
- Header icons are currently non-functional placeholders

### 3. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Purpose:**  
Main Journal screen that displays the timeline of meal entries.

**Functionality:**  
- Implements a FlatList to display meal entries
- Uses mock data for initial development
- Renders MealCard components for each entry
- Provides basic screen layout and styling

**Notes:**  
- Mock data can be replaced with real data source later
- Currently uses hardcoded timestamps
- Performance optimizations can be added for larger lists

### 4. `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`
**Purpose:**  
Placeholder screen for future dashboard functionality.

**Functionality:**  
- Simple screen with centered text
- Basic styling setup

**Notes:**  
- Minimal implementation as per MVP requirements
- Ready for future feature implementation

## Design Constants
```typescript
const COLORS = {
    accent: '#FF6B6B',
    timeline: '#E5E5E5',
    timeText: '#666666',
    cardBackground: '#FFFFFF',
    shadow: '#000000',
};
```

## Dependencies Added
```bash
@react-navigation/native
@react-navigation/bottom-tabs
react-native-screens
react-native-safe-area-context
```

## Next Steps
According to our plan, we can proceed with:
1. Add duration indicators
2. Add status indicators (fasting/regular)
3. Add loading states and pull-to-refresh

## Testing Notes
- Basic functionality is working
- Navigation between tabs is smooth
- Image loading and display is functional
- Time formatting is working correctly
- Timeline visualization matches mockup

## Future Considerations
- Add proper error handling for image loading
- Implement camera/gallery integration
- Add data persistence
- Add loading states and pull-to-refresh
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- Handle different image aspect ratios
- Add press state animations and haptic feedback

## TODOs
1. Handle different image aspect ratios
2. Add press state animations and haptic feedback
3. Optimize image loading performance
4. Add error states for failed image loads
