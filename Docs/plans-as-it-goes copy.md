Here's the refined plan focusing on matching the exact design:
Step 1: Card Layout Refinement
What: Adjust card dimensions and spacing to match mockup exactly
Why: Ensure consistent visual appearance with design
Files: components/journal/MealCard.tsx
Risks:
Different screen sizes might need adjustments
Need to maintain timeline alignment
Step 2: Image Container
What: Update image container to match mockup
Exact border radius (12px)
Proper aspect ratio
Consistent margins
Why: Match visual design specifications
Files: components/journal/MealCard.tsx
Risks:
Need to maintain image quality
Different device sizes consideration
Step 3: Timeline Elements
What: Match timeline styling exactly
Red dot size and color (#FF6B6B)
Vertical line thickness and color
Time text style and positioning
Why: Create cohesive timeline visualization
Files: components/journal/MealCard.tsx
Risks:
Vertical line continuity between cards
Dot alignment with cards
Step 4: Typography and Colors
What: Match exact font styles and colors
Time display format (HH:mm)
Font sizes and weights
Text colors
Why: Maintain design consistency
Files: components/journal/MealCard.tsx
Risks:
Font availability across devices
Text scaling considerations
TODOs for Later:
Handle different image aspect ratios
Add press state animations and haptic feedback
Optimize image loading performance
Add error states for failed image loads
